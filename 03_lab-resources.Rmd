# Lab Resources

## Passwords, Shared Credentials and Room Code

Long list of passwords and keycodes to all lab accounts are listed in the Dropbox under the 'General Lab Documents'. Please keep confidential! 

__If you get locked out:__ 

- If locked out of 208, Slack someone in the lab for the keycode
- If locked of 209 (Testing room), request Teresa to open the door during work hours. If after work, request the security guard downstairs to open the lab 
- PRO TIP: Always make sure the 209 key isnâ€™t in the room before locking the door

## Evernote

Evernote is no longer in use - any important lab documents can be found in the Dropbox or in the Google Drive.

## Dropbox

All materials relevant to lab projects are stored on Dropbox (Usually under Experimental Studies). Each project folder might contain (but limited to) images, audio files, participant tracking spreadsheets, R scripts, data files, and videos related to the project. This is done to ensure a central repository for each project, prevent data loss, allow for cross platform access and remote access. In the future, we plan to create an OSF page and make all our items, data and analysis available to the public to promote open science.
