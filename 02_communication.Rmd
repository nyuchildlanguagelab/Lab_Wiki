# Communication

## Slack

Communication within the Child Language Lab should be conducted through Slack, a communication app that uses channels (#nameofchannel) to communicate to relevant sub-groups or to individuals. Lab members should be familiar with the Slack channels. Using Slack allows us to have work messaging thatâ€™s separable from personal messaging, and faster and more chat-based than email. This is important for open communicating and the on-the-go aspects of the lab like testing.

## Evernote

Log all work you do on lab projects in the Evernote notebook associated with that project. Make sure to include the date, your name, and a clear log of what tasks you have completed and notes for any issues that arise. We keep careful diaries of our projects for two main reasons: (a) our methods must be fully replicable down to the smallest decisions, and (b) we will have multiple people working on the same project, sometimes with significant time in between, so work must be able to be picked up both later and by someone else. Make sure Evernote syncs so all work is accessible to everyone in the CLL.
