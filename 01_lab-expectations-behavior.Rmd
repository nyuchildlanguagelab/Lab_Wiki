# Lab Expectations and Behavior

The Child Language Lab @ NYU strives to make it a safe, enjoyable, and friendly experience for everyone who participates. We are committed to providing a welcoming and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion. We do not tolerate harassment of members in any form. 

## General Expectations

1. Always follow instructions given to you by the Principal Investigator (PI), the Lab Manager, or the appointed project leader for sub-projects. If you are unsure of something, please ask for clarification. Our aim is to foster clear and open communication for CLL projects.

2. Clean-up after yourself. Always try to leave the lab more clean and more organized (or at least as clean and as organized) than when you arrived. Please remember that all spaces are shared, so don’t leave things out  –  put personal items you would like to keep in the lab in the drawer spaces in Room 208.  You are welcome to use the 2nd floor lounge kitchen to store food for the workday, make coffee, etc. If you do, label all food and be considerate of the shared nature of the kitchen space.

3. Be responsible & professional. For example, If you make a mistake on a task, don’t hide it as that will make the situation worse. Let the PI (or project lead, or both) know as soon as possible.

4. The lab is a team, we work together to get research projects designed, piloted, executed, presented and published. A lab member may be asked to take on some duties that are good for the lab as a whole without direct advantage to themselves. Similarly, one may be asked to put off a task or switch task priorities for the good of the lab. Be a team player.  

5. If you are having a problem with someone in the lab, please talk to them about it rather than talking to anyone else about it. Only if you are dissatisfied with the outcome, talk to the lab PI about it.

6. Treat all lab equipment with respect and care. Be courteous and ensure to charge the iPads, Apple Pencil, and Bluetooth keyboards and mice as needed.

## Research/Graduate Student Expectations ^[For a comprehensive list of Graduate Student Expectations, refer to the document entitled CLL_GraduateAdvisorExpectations in the lab Dropbox]

1. It is important that Researchers stay up to date on the primary literature in their area of study. While the PI will point you to relevant readings, each researcher should make an effort to read articles in scientific journals that specifically apply to their interests and projects.

2. Researchers are expected to keep Project Managers and the PI updated on their progress, successes, and concerns. One-on-one meetings can be arranged with the PI for these discussions.

3. Researchers are expected to contribute to the lab as a whole, both intellectually and occasionally with requested research from other projects in the lab (potentially outside of a Graduate Student’s dissertation project). 

4. Researchers are expected to follow all of the lab rules that will be given to you when you begin and potentially updated each semester. This includes completing all required ethics training.

## PI Expectations ^[For a full enumeration of PI Advisor Expectations, refer to the document entitled CLL_GraduateAdvisorExpectations in the lab Dropbox]
1. The PI has the responsibility of meeting regularly with the Graduate Students she advises to discuss their research and academic training. One should give the PI advance notice when scheduling a meeting to find a suitable time. 

2. The PI has the responsibility of advising students on how to proceed according to their prospective career paths, and will offer continual assistance with research projects that is fully described in the Dropbox document.

## Behavior

__Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behaviour and speech.__ Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

- deliberate intimidation;
- inappropriate physical contact;
- use of sexual or discriminatory imagery, comments, or jokes
