# Updating the Wiki

## Updating from Docs

If you need to change or information in the wiki, edit the google doc entitled "Wiki Information". If you do not update the github page when you update the docs, leave a comment on any changes you made with the date that you made them so that someone can update the website with the changes. 

## Updating Website

1. Open the R project "NYU Child Language Lab Manual.Rproj" from the folder in downloads called "CLL-wiki" in RStudio.
2. Locate the .Rmd file in the bottom right panel of RStudio that you wish to edit. If you wish to create a .Rmd file, name it "(chapter number)_Title" and adjust the subsequent chapter numbers if you created a chapter in the middle of the current chapters. The only formatting requirement for creating a new chapter is to start the .Rmd file with "# Title".
3. Edit the text in the .Rmd file. If this requires any formatting refer to the [RMarkdown cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rmarkdown-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf).
4. Save all changes in RStudio. 
5. Open up the terminal^[You may be prompted by the terminal somewhere in this process for our github username and password. These can be found on the passwords page in Evernote.] and type into the command line:

```
cd ~/Downloads/CLL-wiki
```
6. You are now in the project directory, which is connected to the github repository for the website. Next, in the order given, enter into the commmand line:

```
git add .
```
The updated files are now in the repository
```
git commit -m "Updated (Write Date of Update)"
```
The version you are uploading is now saved in github.
```
git push -u origin master
```
7. The files are now sent to the github repository, and if you check the webpage it should be updated!
