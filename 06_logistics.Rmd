## Lab Meetings ^[Before the semester begins, the lab manager will contact the lab managers/PI of either lab spaces to check availability and block of a time slot that works best for lab members.]

We hold lab meetings once a week during the semester and at the discretion of the PI during the summer. Lab meetings usually involve check-ins on recruiting and testinge fforts, data blitzes, presentations (lab internal and external) and feedback on projects. Location and time vary by semester and pandemic status.

## Snacks [on hold during pandemic]

The lab manager is entrusted to get snacks for each lab meeting. The lab usually allots a budget of $20/wk for bagels and coffee. After buying said snacks, the lab manager is reimbursed from the PIâ€™s research funds.
