## How to Handle Routine Testing Session

1. Have consent form ready, explain studies and operation, and sign
2. Note on consent form what number participant they are for each study they do. Adult forms all go in the “completed adult consent forms” folder. Child forms all go in the completed child forms folder for each respective study; if a child participates in more than one study, make a photocopy of the form, write that they participated in more than one study at the top, and place it one each applicable folder.
3. Offer food/snack, be welcoming and accommodating etc
4. Run study(s)
5. If adults do >=2 studies, reimburse afterwards with $10 (found in top drawer in office room) and fill out receipt
6. If the participant is a child, offer a toy and CLL t-shirt
7. As soon as a study is done, add all demographic information to the tracking sheet for the respective study. Make sure to mark the date, location (lab or name of daycare), P-number, and child’s name!!!!!


## Experiment Overviews {#expov}

### Exhaustivity (Alicia) {-} 

Children meet Og, the caveman. Og looks at pictures of animals and objects, and then he describes the pictures, but sometimes he says something that's wrong or a little silly. For example, if Og sees a picture of two blue ducks and one red one, he might say "There are two blue ducks" (a correct thing), or he might say "There are two red ducks" (a silly thing). The child's job is to reward Og with strawberries to help him learn what a good way to describe the picture versus what a silly way is. When Og does a good job describing the picture, he should get three strawberries. When Og says something silly, he should get one strawberry or maybe two. 

- Time: 10-12 minutes 
- Age: 4-6
- Materials: Answer sheet, laptop to play video, toy strawberries

### Count Kiddo (Maxime) {-} 

Children are introduced to three ‘kippies’ (fun made-up characters) who want to buy some patterned hats from a wizard. The children are told what each hat costs (hats with stars cost a star, hats with hearts cost a heart and hats with circles cost a circle), and that the kippies will each choose a hat. The kippies then choose a hat and the wizard speaks to one of the kippies. The children are instructed to figure out who the wizard is talking to. They will be told that sometimes the wizard talks about the now, but sometimes he talks about how things could be different instead. The wizard could say something along the lines of "I wish that kippie’s hat had hearts, so he would give me a heart!" (corresponding image: three kippies, one with a hat with stars, one with a hat with hearts, and one who used to wear a starry hat but took it off for now). A narrator will repeat the utterance and then ask: “Who’s the king talking to?” After which the child is prompted to tap on the corresponding character displayed on an iPad. In between trials, children will collect stickers/stamps on a separate piece of paper.

- Time: 15-20 minutes
- Age: 3-5
- Materials: Hats and stickers, laptop/tablet to play video, recorder or qualitative answer key

### KidBiComp (Sarah) {-} 

Children meet Sylvia, a young Spanish-English bilingual girl who lives next to a farm. Sylvia invites the child to play a game similar to 'I Spy', where she looks out her window and says phrases like, "the dog runs", "el perro corre", or even "el perro runs." The child will see two different images and has to find the image that matches what Sylvia says. The animals and actions vary, but Sylvia describes them the same way. 

- Time: 15 minutes
- Age: 2-3
- Materials: eye tracker, questionnaire
- Other: Children must be bilingual Spanish-English

### ModForceJr {-} 

Children are introduced to Cat (a cartoon cat) and Logan (a puppet who watches the video with the child). Cat is planning a birthday party, and the kids are told that Logan will make statements about the images of Cat running errands, but that Logan doesn't always pay attention, so sometimes he says something silly. The narrator then says something along the lines of "Cat is going to the bakery to buy a birthday cake for the party! There are two ways to get to the bakery; the red road, and the green road. But uh oh! The green road is blocked" (corresponding image of a blocked green road and open red road). Then Logan will say "to get to the bakery, Cat can't go down the green road." The narrator asks whether the child thinks Logan is right. That model is repeated a few times, sometimes Logan is right and sometimes he is wrong, and then we see an image of the finished party with some fun music!

- Time: 10 minutes
- Age: 3 ½-4 ½ 
- Materials: Answer key, iPad

### Fuzzy NomNoms {-} 

Children are shown two animals on the screen that look very similar (e.g., a sheep and a llama), and are then showed an animal in the middle of the screen that is hiding behind the curtain. It looks like it could be either animal and at this point, the child either hears sentences like "It's maybe a sheep", or "It's probably a sheep", while we track the child’s eye-movements to see what they pay attention to on screen in response to such sentences. In this way, we infer the stages along the development path to learning abstract language. 

- Time: 30 minutes
- Age: 2-3
- Materials: Eye tracker, headband/clips, cutouts of animals for familiarization

### All About ME {-} 

Children are introduced to Pterry the Pterodactyl and Cera the Triceratops, who both comment on pictures using words like must, might and is. The child is then asked “who said it better,” and the child comments on whether Pterry or Cera’s comment was better. 

- Time: 15 minutes
- Age: 5-9
- Materials: answer key, iPad, puppets
