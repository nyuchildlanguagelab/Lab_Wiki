Click on tabs to the left to explore our site! Links Lab website PI Website Lab Facebook Page Location: Room 208 and 209 (Floor 2), 10 Washington Place, Department of Linguistics Mission Statement We are interested in better understanding how young children solve the complex language learning problems they are faced with, specifically for abstract words or constructions that cannot be taught or pointed to (e.g., how do you show a child the meaning of must or think?). To do so, we combine expertise in linguistics, cognitive science and developmental psychology to help us understand just how children accomplish these learning feats. We run experiments and do corpus work. By learning more about childrens abstract language development, this research contributes directly to our knowledge about human linguistic and cognitive development, and indirectly to the improvement of early language assessment and intervention. 1.1 Lab Members PI Dr. Ailis Cournane Lab manager Charlotte McFarland Graduate Students Maxime Tulling; Alicia Parrish; Sarah Phillips; Chiara Repetti-Ludlow; Anna Alsop; Naomi Lee; Mary Robinson RAs Madisen Fong; Mark Bacon; Maya Wallis; Maya Orey; Isha Rahman Interns NA Alumni Dunja Veselinovic; Hayden Kee; Yohei Oseki; Deborah Hapern; Kathyrn Rafailov; Jenna Pollan; Sasha Frangulov; Daniella Presti; Sam Mitchell; Rachel Arbacher; Michael Marinaccio; Max Manicone; Stacy Gerchick, Nicolette Cure; Michelle Golden; Hannah Mattis-Roesch; Paloma Jereti 1.2 Current Projects 1 Fuzzy NomNoms (Maxime): Investigates the acquisition and comprehension of the modal adverb maybe and negator not in 2-3 year old children.

We are committed to providing a welcoming and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion. We do not tolerate harassment of members in any form. 2.1 Lab Hierarchy Principle Investigator (PI): Creator and leader of the lab, responsible for intellectual leadership and output, securing and maintaining funding, supervising projects, and making major decisions (among other roles). Professor, so is also doing other things related and unrelated to the lab (teaching courses, publishing and presenting, advising other graduate student work, administrative roles, applying for grants, etc.) PhD Students: Researchers/students working on projects in the lab. Typically, PhD student roles in the lab overlap with those of the PI: they are also responsible for intellectual integrity and output, for the projects they lead (usually part of their degree requirements) and/or are authors on. They are under the supervision of the PI. They are also doing much work related and unrelated to the lab (e.g., taking/TA-ing/teaching courses, applying for jobs, publishing and presenting, mentoring other students, etc.) Lab Manager: Overseer and manager of lab hardware, systems, information, participant recruiting efforts; communicating between projects; maintains online presence; interfaces with parents and daycares. Pitches in to help PI and Project Leader as needed. Jack/Jill of All Trades. Project Leader: This role overlaps with other roles, as it refers to who is in charge of the lab work related to a specific project. This person is the point person for that project, and is typically a PhD student (but may be the PI, an undergraduate student, or a current or part lab manager). Undergraduate RAs, Interns: RAs (usually an NYU student) and Interns (usually not an NYU student) work on various tasks and projects in the lab. Typically they work primarily on a specific project, mentored by a particular PhD Student and/or the PI. RAs/Interns may work for pay (typically when linked to specific grants), course credit, or research experience (typically not possible for NYU students, who should be either paid or receive credit). 2.1.1 When and for how long people work RA (Paid): ~15 hrs/week (dependent on funding source) RA (Research; unpaid, course credit): ~5-10 hrs/week Intern (Unpaid) ~8 hrs/week Lab Manager (Part-time): ~6-10 hrs/week Lab Manager (Full-time): Up to 35 hrs/week 2.2 General Expectations Always follow instructions given to you by the Principal Investigator (PI: Ailis Cournane), the Lab Manager, or the appointed project leader (typically PhD students) for sub-projects. If you are unsure of something, please ask for clarification. Our aim is to foster clear and open communication for CLL projects. Clean-up after yourself. Always try to leave the lab more clean and more organized (or at least as clean and as organized) than when you arrived. Please remember that all spaces are shared, so dont leave things out  put personal items you would like to keep in the lab in the drawer spaces in Room 208 (labeled accordingly). You are welcome to use the 2nd floor lounge kitchen to store food for the workday, make coffee, etc. If you do, label all food and be considerate of the shared nature of the kitchen space. Be responsible &amp; professional. For example, If you make a mistake on a task, dont hide it as that will make the situation worse. Let the PI (or lab manager, project lead, or both) know as soon as possible. The lab is a team. We work together to get research projects designed, piloted, executed, presented and published. A lab member may be asked to take on some duties that are good for the lab as a whole without direct advantage to themselves. Similarly, one may be asked to put off a task or switch task priorities for the good of the lab. Be a team player. If you are having a problem with someone in the lab, please talk to them about it rather than talking to anyone else about it. Only if you are dissatisfied with the outcome, talk to the lab PI about it. Treat all lab equipment with respect and care. Be courteous and ensure to leave the equipment ready for future use (e.g. charge the iPads, Apple Pencil, and Bluetooth keyboards and mice as needed). Complete Ethics (CITI) training and always follow best ethical practices for working with human participants, noting that children are a special case as they cannot consent for themselves. If you have questions, ask more senior lab members as soon as possible. 2.3 Research/Graduate Student Expectations Stay up to date on the primary literature in your area of study. While the PI will point you to relevant readings, each researcher should make an active and concerted effort to read articles in scientific journals that specifically apply to their interests and projects. Keep the PI updated on your progress, successes, and concerns via Slack or in Lab Meetings. One-on-one meetings can be arranged with the PI for these discussions. PhD Students/Project Leaders are expected to contribute to the lab as a whole, both intellectually and occasionally with requested research from other projects in the lab. The PI has the responsibility of meeting regularly with you to discuss your research and academic training. One should give the PI advance notice (at least a week) when scheduling a meeting to find a suitable time (unless you have a standing meeting). The PI has the responsibility of advising you on how to proceed according to prospective career paths, and will offer continual assistance with research projects. The goals are always to get lab projects presented and published (science is meant to be shared!) and to get lab members on to the next stage in their education or career. 2.4 Behavior Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behaviour and speech. Harassment includes, but is not limited to: deliberate intimidation; inappropriate physical contact; use of sexual or discriminatory imagery, comments, or jokes unwelcome sexual attention. If you feel that someone has harassed you or otherwise treated you inappropriately, please alert the PI or any other member on the team. If any member or project participant engages in harassing behaviour, the senior staff may take any action we deem appropriate. "],["communication.html", "3 Communication 3.1 Slack 3.2 GMail", " 3 Communication 3.1 Slack Slack Workspace URL: nyuchildlanguagelab.slack.com Communication within the Child Language Lab should be conducted through Slack, a communication app that uses channels (#nameofchannel) to communicate to relevant sub-groups or to individuals. Lab members should be familiar with the Slack channels. Using Slack allows us to have work messaging thats separable from personal messaging, and faster and more chat-based than email. This is important for open communicating and the on-the-go aspects of the lab like testing. 3.2 GMail Email Account Name: nyuchildlanguagelab [at] gmail [dot] com To assist with making emails and past correspondances easier to find, the email has several labels corresponding to studies, miscellaneous correspondances, and status of any participants. The goal is to keep all currently relevant emails in the inbox and, once a study is completed, for example, to save the email out of sight but still within reach of searching for it. If you ever need to adjust filters (see below) then you can do so by clicking the gear icon in the top right of the inbox, clicking See all settings, and going to the Filters and Blocked Addresses tab. 3.2.1 Email Searching To search for past emails, such as looking up whether someone has been contacted for a study before, then in the search bar you can simply type from:email@address.here (using an actual email). To be more thorough, you can add in:anywhere at the beginning which will include Spam and Trash folders. To be more specific, click on a label and GMail will append something like label:Study-Labels/ to the search query. 3.2.2 Labels Under Study Labels, you will find a label for each of the respective studies currently ongoing at the CLL. Inbound emails are automatically assigned their respective study label given a specific keyword (based off of Calendlys formatting). For example, if an email comes in with the words CountKiddo, the green CountKiddo label will be automatically applied to it in the inbox. In the event an email isnt properly labeled, you can simply add the label with the label button at the top of the inbox page. Under Meta Labels, there are labels that refer to the status of studies and/or anything related to studies, but not someone participating in a study. Event/Recruitment pertains to all emails regarding recruiting participants or running events with organizations, including advertisements. Past Adult Participants is a section for, well, past adult participants who participated in one of the studies. As for the Status Labels, under the Meta Labels tab, the New Signup is automated. The filter looks for any email that contains A new event has been scheduled (from Calendly) and adds the flashy red label- alongside the relevant study label (see above)- so that the participant can be contacted. Once contacted, this label should be manually removed using the label button on the top of the email window and then tagged with Awaiting Response. Once contacted, emails can be (but dont need to be) dragged into the Awaiting Response label, thus taken out of the inbox. When a reply comes in, the email will show up in the inbox once more. Lastly, when the study has finished, the email chain should be marked with Completed and dragged into its relevant study label. When an email is dragged into one label, it still maintains any other labels it has been assigned. 2 Finally, the Archive and Admin labels. The Archive label (yes, that is a Rolodex emoji) contains all emails that werent caught by the filtering and/or were before current procedures were put in place between 2018 and 2020. Each year has its respective label. The Admin label contains anything about meetings, lab internals, research requests, etc. that doesnt have relation to studies or study-specific events. As of August 5th, 2021, when the labels were created, nothing was properly automated so these status labels are completely empty. In theory, all the emails (as of that date) would technically be marked as Completed.

Please keep confidential! No one outside the lab should ever be given this info. If you have to update a password, update it on this list too or ask the Lab Manager to do so (and communicate the change)! If you get locked out: If locked out of 208, Slack someone in the lab for the keycode If locked of 209 (Testing room), ask Teresa Leung to open the door during work hours. If after work, ask the security guard downstairs to open the lab PRO TIP: Always make sure the 209 key isnt in the room before locking the door All important lab documents can be found in the Dropbox or the Google Drive. For project specifics, check in with the lead of that project. 4.2 Dropbox Account Email: nyuchildlanguagelab [at] icloud [dot] com3 All materials relevant to lab projects are stored on Dropbox (Usually under Experimental Studies). Each project folder might contain (but not limited to) images, audio files, participant tracking spreadsheets, R scripts, data files, and videos related to the project. This is done to ensure a central repository for each project, prevent data loss, allow for cross-platform access and remote access. he Dropbox folders can also be processed and posted to e.g., an OSF page to make all our items, data and analysis available to the public to promote open science (linked to particular publications, typically). 4.3 Software Packages R, Matlab, Penn Controller, MTurk, Experiment Builder, Data Viewer 4.4 Physical Inventory Visit the lab rooms and familiarize yourself with the items and hardware needed for your work in the lab. Generally, rm208 is the office for working on the lab computers/tablets (or ones own pc). This room has a double-sided desk, two computers, tablets (kept in the drawers), whiteboards, and other office-y items. Whiteboard markers can be replenished from the Linguistics supply cupboard in the kitchen area next to the lab. Rm209 is the experiment room, housing the eye tracking equipment and testing area, a child-sized table and chairs for behavioural tasks, a comfortable chair for parents, and storage for testing supplies (consent and testing forms by-study, gifts and lab t-shirts for child participants) and other lab items (equipment, stickers, business cards, costume items, puppets, etc).

Note that the participant completed the study on the form afterwards. Note on consent form what number participant they are for each study they do. Adult forms all go in the completed adult consent forms folder. Child forms all go in the completed child forms folder for each respective study; if a child participates in more than one study, make a photocopy of the form, write that they participated in more than one study at the top, and place it one each applicable folder.

Make sure to mark the date, location (lab or name of daycare), P-number, and childs name. 6.2 How to Handle a Testing Session Over Zoom 6.2.1 Recruiting / Before the experiment After identifying suitable participants for a given study on the CLL Sign-up Responses, contact them using the studys respective template (make sure Calendly link is attached). Once the participant has scheduled a time slot on Calendly, send them a confirmation email with the Zoom link you will use, a questionnaire, and a consent form. In the message, ask that the guardian be present to help with any technology issues but that they do not interfere with the childs responses. Send a reminder email one day before the participation date. If necessary, remind the participant that they need to complete and send back the consent and questionnaire form before the study can take place. Whenever you receive the consent form and questionnaire, upload it to the proper Google Drive/Dropbox folder. On the scheduled day, check the respective studys Participant Tracker to see which trial/list should be used and assign the participant an ID number. Download the appropriate slideshow and run through it to familiarize yourself with the audio prompts and correct any possible animation/timing errors. Additionally, download the scoring sheet (make sure it matches the slideshow and trial/list you are running). 6.2.2 Running the study Greet child and guardian; take a moment to introduce yourself and try to make participants feel as comfortable as possible. Briefly reiterate how the activity will go and gently remind the guardian not to interfere with the childs responses. Get the childs verbal assent (i.e. Do you want to play this game?). Share your computer screen with the experiment slideshow, ensuring to allow any necessary Zoom access (i.e. Share computer sound or Give screen control) Run the study as trained to do. 6.2.3 After the Experiment Upload the completed scoring sheet to the proper Google Drive/Dropbox folder. Add all demographic information to the CLL-Database sheet for the respective study. Make sure to mark the date, location (online), P-number, and childs name. Send a thank-you note to the guardian with a storybook attached. 6.3 How to Handle a Testing Session Onsite (i.e. a daycare) TBD 6.4 Experiment Overviews Count Kiddo (Maxime) Children are introduced to three kippies (fun made-up characters) who want to buy some patterned hats from a wizard. The children are told what each hat costs (hats with stars cost a star, hats with hearts cost a heart and hats with circles cost a circle), and that the kippies will each choose a hat. The kippies then choose a hat and the wizard speaks to one of the kippies. The children are instructed to figure out who the wizard is talking to. They will be told that sometimes the wizard talks about the now, but sometimes he talks about how things could be different instead. The wizard could say something along the lines of I wish that kippies hat had hearts, so he would give me a heart! (corresponding image: three kippies, one with a hat with stars, one with a hat with hearts, and one who used to wear a starry hat but took it off for now). A narrator will repeat the utterance and then ask: Whos the king talking to? After which the child is prompted to tap on the corresponding character displayed on an iPad. In between trials, children will collect stickers/stamps on a separate piece of paper. Time: 15-20 minutes Age: 3-5 Materials: Hats and stickers, laptop/tablet to play video, recorder or qualitative answer key KidBiComp (Sarah) Children meet Sylvia, a young Spanish-English bilingual girl who lives next to a farm. Sylvia invites the child to play a game similar to I Spy, where she looks out her window and says phrases like, the dog runs, el perro corre, or even el perro runs. The child will see two different images and has to find the image that matches what Sylvia says. The animals and actions vary, but Sylvia describes them the same way. Time: 15 minutes Age: 2-3 Materials: eye tracker, questionnaire Other: Children must be bilingual Spanish-English ModForceJr Children are introduced to Cat (a cartoon cat) and Logan (a puppet who watches the video with the child). Cat is planning a birthday party, and the kids are told that Logan will make statements about the images of Cat running errands, but that Logan doesnt always pay attention, so sometimes he says something silly. The narrator then says something along the lines of Cat is going to the bakery to buy a birthday cake for the party! There are two ways to get to the bakery; the red road, and the green road. But uh oh! The green road is blocked (corresponding image of a blocked green road and open red road). Then Logan will say to get to the bakery, Cat cant go down the green road. The narrator asks whether the child thinks Logan is right. That model is repeated a few times, sometimes Logan is right and sometimes he is wrong, and then we see an image of the finished party with some fun music! Time: 10 minutes Age: 3 ½-4 ½ Materials: Answer key, iPad Fuzzy NomNoms Children are shown two animals on the screen that look very similar (e.g., a sheep and a llama), and are then showed an animal in the middle of the screen that is hiding behind the curtain. It looks like it could be either animal and at this point, the child either hears sentences like Its maybe a sheep, or Its probably a sheep, while we track the childs eye-movements to see what they pay attention to on screen in response to such sentences. In this way, we infer the stages along the development path to learning abstract language. Time: 30 minutes Age: 2-3 Materials: Eye tracker, headband/clips, cutouts of animals for familiarization [ON HOLD] All About ME Children are introduced to Pterry the Pterodactyl and Cera the Triceratops, who both comment on pictures using words like must, might and is. The child is then asked who said it better, and the child comments on whether Pterry or Ceras comment was better. Time: 15 minutes Age: 5-9 Materials: answer key, iPad, puppets CFWaterpark For this task, children will play a short guessing game involving three animals playing in a waterpark (crocodile, penguin, and giraffe). Children are presented with short stories, followed by some questions about those stories. They are asked to guess where giraffe is, based on where the other two animals are, and are asked to explain their choices. This game allows us to learn more about how children reason about possibilities, and understand what kinds of possibilities they are able to reason over. Time: 15 minutes Age: 5-7 &amp; adults Materials: SqueakyMice Children are invited to play a computer game over zoom with the researcher. The game involves little stories with different animals (mice, bees, ants, fish) playing in different locations. Some of the animals make noises and some do not, and your childs task is to pick which groups of animals to click on to see if theyre noisy, based on what the mama animal says. We also ask children to explain their choices, to better understand how they are interpreting the scenario and language. This fun little game helps us learn more about how children understand the kinds of sentences used when we talk about rules and desires/goals. Time: 20 minutes Age: 5-7 &amp; adults Materials: Scratch, Zoom, computer/laptop, answer key 6.4.1 [In Development] Panoo (Maxime) Children are introduced to a toy character (Panoo) and his friend who looks identical. They are put inside a box and the narrator (Lily) does something to the box, e.g. paints it, accidentally affecting one of the toys as well (e.g. spilling paint). Lily opens the box and looks inside, and says something, e.g. Oh no Panoo is all wet!. Then the child is shown the inside of the box where there are Panoo and his friend, one of them wet. The child is asked Wheres Panoo? Can you find him? while we track the childs eye-movements to see what they pay attention to on screen in response to such sentences. In this way, we try to infer whether they updated their discourse representation with different types of information (factual, modal and counterfactual). Time: 20 minutes Age: 2&amp;3 Materials: Eye tracker, headband/clips, toy Lily. [Completed] Exhaustivity (Alicia) Children meet Og, the caveman. Og looks at pictures of animals and objects, and then he describes the pictures, but sometimes he says something thats wrong or a little silly. For example, if Og sees a picture of two blue ducks and one red one, he might say There are two blue ducks (a correct thing), or he might say There are two red ducks (a silly thing). The childs job is to reward Og with strawberries to help him learn what a good way to describe the picture versus what a silly way is. When Og does a good job describing the picture, he should get three strawberries. When Og says something silly, he should get one strawberry or maybe two. Time: 10-12 minutes Age: 4-6 Materials: Answer sheet, laptop to play video, toy strawberries "],["logistics.html", "7 Logistics 7.1 Lab Meetings 5 7.2 Snacks [on hold during pandemic]", " 7 Logistics 7.1 Lab Meetings 5 We hold lab meetings once a week during the semester and at the discretion of the PI during the summer. Lab meetings usually involve check-ins on recruiting and testinge fforts, data blitzes, presentations (lab internal and external) and feedback on projects. Location and time vary by semester and pandemic status. 7.2 Snacks [on hold during pandemic] The lab manager is entrusted to get snacks for each lab meeting. The lab usually allots a budget of $20/wk for bagels and coffee. After buying said snacks, the lab manager is reimbursed from the PIs research funds. Before the semester begins, the lab manager will contact the lab managers/PI of either lab spaces to check availability and block of a time slot that works best for lab members. "],["recruiting-and-engagement-most-important-thing.html", "8 Recruiting and Engagement (MOST IMPORTANT THING) 8.1 Recruiting", " 8 Recruiting and Engagement (MOST IMPORTANT THING) 8.1 Recruiting Recruiting involves a combination of calling/emailing daycares, parents, and scheduling participants that sign up through the labs Google form, or contacting individuals who have participated in our research before. We also use social media platforms (IG, FB) to recruit, but posting content and boosting some posts (i.e., paying to have them appear on peoples feeds, to increase sign-ups). We also use word-of-mouth and tap our own networks. Getting child participants is very difficult, so we must work extra hard on this and be creative! Calling Off-Campus Sites Calls should ideally be made from the phone in the lab (Phone # 212 998 7916). To call, dial 9 then 1 followed by the phone number. We primarily call daycares in the 5 boroughs as well as NJ, Long Island and Westchester County. Prior to making a phone call, study the calling script (found on the Dropbox under All Recruiting &amp; Testing Docs) and get a feel for the kind of responses we give. Dont memorize the script verbatim at the risk of sounding too robotic. You want to sound friendly and stress that the responsibilities of the daycare will be minimal. Try not to use the word experiment, as this can sound invasive and can turn people off. Use phrases like we are running a study or we play fun games with kids, and their answers provide us with important information about how they process language It is helpful to shadow a current RA/PhD Student to get a sense of the mechanics of the phone call. Once you feel comfortable making a call, call daycares listed under the Locations Tab on the CLL-Database (or add new ones). _Make sure you understand how the database works, and you take good notes on locations! As you work your way through a list, update contact information if needed and make comments on responses from the contact at the daycare. Comments include: If interested, send an email with the required attachments (DropBox/ALL RECRUITING &amp; TESTING DOCS: look for most up to date stamped IRB forms for the following: Institutional Consent, Letter of Cooperation and Consent Forms) which can be found as a template in the lab email. Once you send an email, flag that you have emailed them and make a note to follow up in a week If completely uninterested and do not wish to be called back, flag the day care and make sure not to call again. If a daycare responds with the required documents filled out, send the Letter Cooperation to the PI for approval from the IRB. Once approved, give a week or two to have the daycare get parents to sign consent forms and then schedule a day to go in. Facebook &amp; Instagram Outreach We should be posting on Facebook and Instagram regularly (somewhere between 1 and 3 times a week). Try not to post multiple times a day, but rather, spread it out over the week. You can do this by scheduling posts. Content generally consists of cool/informative videos about kids and language learning, Lab Member spotlights, and announcements about new studies and activities. Look at our previous posts for inspiration, or feel free to start a new series/trend. In general, dont make it too wordy and include visuals if possible! If we have something especially important to post (e.g. our lab video when it is complete), you can talk to Ailis about paying to boost the post, so it reaches more users. Run any language facts by Ailis and/or PhD Students before posting, to make sure they are scientifically accurate and up-to-date and consistent with the lab brand. Aside from posting on our own page, posting in existing groups makes a BIG difference. Local neighborhood groups, NY parent groups, kids activities groups, and groups for local institutions (local parks, childrens museums, etc.) are all good places to post. Sometimes this involves applying to the group or contacting the admins of the group directly, which can all be done using the lab facebook page. Scheduling At the beginning of each semester, RAs should pick out times they can be in the lab and block out those times on the google calendar. Once we have the times filled out, the lab manager/RA can fill up those times in the Calendly, the labs scheduling system. When adults or parents of sign up through the google form through the website, their information ends up in a database of sign ups (which can be found in the Google Drive). An RA then follows up with participants in these lists by sending an email from the lab account with the study information and a Calendly link to schedule a time to come in. Once they sign up, both parties will receive a notification and the time slot will be automatically added to the lab calendar. The RA will then write a confirmation e-mail to the parent, and (if study is online) send a consent form for the caregiver to fill out - each RA is responsible for sending these (template emails for each study can be found in the lab gmail account). A day before testing, the participant will receive a reminder. The RA scheduled to work that time slot will be responsible for running the experiment. "],["offboarding-and-leaving-the-lab.html", "9 Offboarding and Leaving the Lab", " 9 Offboarding and Leaving the Lab Give up ID and offload all information linked to your NYU ID to the lab. Erase passwords from your brain (or more practically, from your computer(s)). Make sure to unlink any/all of your personal accounts from lab accounts (if you had any links, normally this is discouraged for security and organization reasons). Make sure there is a record (here, on the Drive, in Dropbox) of your presence and contributions during your tenure in the lab, with an eye towards continuity and others being able to pick up where you left off. Communication is key, even when youre leaving. If you have any data or other lab-related files on your personal machines only, make sure they are uploaded to the lab Dropbox. Again, others should be able to pick up where you left off. Let the PI (and when relevant, project leaders youve been working with) know how to reach you if needed. If you are an Author on a lab project that is not completed prior to your leaving NYU, make sure you have a plan with Ailis (and other stakeholders in the publication) for how that work will reach publication. Remember, publications are the ultimate goal: they help Ailis get Tenure and further grants (essential for lab operations and Student/RA support), PhD students get academic and related jobs, and our work get shared (were creating knowledge for everyone, and publishing is the way to make that happen). "],["publications.html", "10 Publications 6", " 10 Publications 6 Authorship on scientific publications is based on significant contributions to the intellectual input, execution of studies, and writing of papers. Here is the statement on authorship from the journal Evolution: Authorship of a paper carries with it responsibility as well as credit. All those whose names appear as authors should have played a significant role in designing or carrying out the research, writing the manuscript, or providing extensive guidance to the execution of the project. They should be able to present and defend the work in a public forum. Within the CLL, the PI (Ailís Cournane) has final say on all authorship issues for work conducted by lab members in whole or in part during ones tenure in the lab. However, as a general guideline, the default policies are stated below. These are subject to change and to modification for specific circumstances, including but not limited to exceptionally high or minimal contribution. Regarding standard research publications, the criterion for co-authorship is contribution in any one or combination of the following three areas: intellectual input (including initial design and subsequent modification and development of the project); execution (including data analysis); and writing of the paper (including figure and table preparation) for submission. We also abide by the Evolution criterion that all authors should be able to present and defend all the work, not just their piece of the work, in a public forum. Such a presentation should include accurate and thorough discussion of the relation of the work to other published studies on the topic. For authorship, there must have been intellectual input and engagement To be considered for first author, the researcher must have contributed &gt;50% of the writing of the final draft as well as significant contribution to either the intellectual input or execution of the project. If the paper drafts given to the PI are so poorly prepared (as determined by the PI) that rewriting from scratch is easier than editing, first authorship by the writer may be forfeited. Writing in a timely, prioritized (it is THE most important part of the job) fashion is essential: The first author has no more than 4 months from the end of data collection for a particular publication, as determined by the lab PI, to prepare the paper draft. Failure to produce a well-prepared draft in this timeframe may forfeit the right to first-authorship. It does not need to be perfect, it needs to be drafted (=exist) and get subjected to edits and contributions from the other authors (especially the last author, typically Ailis). For review papers, authorship requires the incorporation of a significant amount of writing. As above, if a potential author submits text that is either rewritten or otherwise omitted from the final version, authorship may be nullified. Adapted from Noor Lab (Noor, 2012) "],["updating-the-wiki.html", "11 Updating the Wiki 11.1 Updating from Docs 11.2 Updating Website", " 11 Updating the Wiki 11.1 Updating from Docs If you need to change or information in the wiki, edit the google doc entitled Wiki Information. If you do not update the github page when you update the docs, leave a comment on any changes you made with the date that you made them so that someone can update the website with the changes. 11.2 Updating Website The website is hosted on GitHub. By making changes and committing, or uploading, those changes to GitHub, the website will automatically update. The wiki is written using a library called BookDown which uses Markdown Syntax and edited in R Studio. Youll need to install Git for the updating portion of this to work properly, as well as logging in to the CLL GitHub account on your computer. Git, in short, is a platform for code collaboration. It has many commands and can get confusing, but follow the updating guide below and you shouldnt need to learn much of it. 11.2.1 Installing R If you do not already have it installed, download RStudio. If you dont have the above installed, youll probably need to install R itself. Installation is more or less click-and-go. Lastly, within RStudio, find the tab labeled Packages (it should be on the bottom right window by default), select Install on the top left of this window, and type in bookdown. This is necessary for the following steps. 11.2.2 Updating the Lab Wiki Files Download the GitHub wiki as a zip, or clone the directory via Git. These steps assume you have downloaded/cloned the wiki into downloads. If its elsewhere, mentally replace downloads with wherever the repository, or files of code from GitHub, is located. Open the R project NYU Child Language Lab Manual.Rproj from the folder in downloads called CLL-wiki in RStudio. Within RStudio, locate the .Rmd file in the bottom right panel of RStudio that you wish to edit, i.e. 11_updating-wiki.Rmd. If you wish to create a .Rmd file, name it \"(chapter number)_Title\" and adjust the subsequent chapter numbers if you created a chapter in the middle of the current chapters. The only formatting requirement for creating a new chapter is to start the .Rmd file with # Title. Edit the text in the .Rmd file. If this requires any formatting refer to the RMarkdown cheatsheet. Save all changes in RStudio. Press the Build Book button in the top right panel of RStudio, and when the book is previewed, check that your changes look good. If Build Book does not there, see step 3 of Installing R above. Open up the terminal7 and type into the command line: cd ~/Downloads/CLL-wiki cd stands for change directory. It simply says hey computer! the commands were about to execute come from this folder. If you have CLL-wiki, whether downloaded or cloned, in another folder, change the directory accordingly. You can also type cd (space included) and drag the folder into the terminal and it should automatically add the path. You are now in the project directory, which is connected to the github repository for the website. Next, in the order given, enter into the commmand line: git add . The updated files are now in the repository. This command is effectively a precursor to say \"hey git! Im about to push some files, and the following files (. stands for all files) are going to be included in that push. Youve written a letter that youre ready to send out. git commit -m &quot;Updated (Write Date of Update)&quot; The version you are uploading is now ready to be sent to the GitHub repository. The letter has been sealed and stemped. One last step! git push -u origin master The files are now sent to the GitHub repository. The letter has been dropped in the mailbox and, unlike the US Post Office, the letter will arrive within seconds. Check the lab website and it should be updated very very shortly! You may be prompted by the terminal somewhere in this process for our github username and password. These can be found on the passwords page in Dropbox "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed). You may want to try searching to find the page's new location, or use the table of contents to find the page you are looking for. "]]
